## How to Run (for collaborators)

1. Install Node.js v10 via https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/

The LTS version may conflict with the current configuration. If you are currently using Node.js v11+, please use nvm via https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md

2. Clone this repo.

3. In a command line (terminal), run: 
```
$ npm install
$ npm audit fix
$ npm start
```

4. In a web browser, access `localhost:3000` (Chrome works best).
